Welcome to the exciting and thoughtful picword game.
## picword
This game is made with Java programming language and netbeans IDE.
We tried to challenge your intelligence in this game and we ask you to connect the shapes inside the photo.
This program includes two different games that you can play with your family.

This game is made by the hrm group, which is actually the university project of the group members.
